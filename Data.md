In order to judge the severity of a hypothetical car accident, we must take into account a variety of attributes from the Data-Collision.csv file. The file includes various attributes such as road condition, weather, etc. Using that very data, which ranges from the road condition to whether or not the driver was under influence, correlations between various attributes will be measured between the severity of the car accidents. We will build a model that understands these correlations and in turn can make a prediction of the severity of a car accident based on those very attributes.
