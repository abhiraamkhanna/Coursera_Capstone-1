The problem is quite clear: car accidents. It is also obvious that car accidents have adverse effects on us since they can injure us, damage our property, or even prove fatal. So, is there a way to mitigate the number of accidents? Could it be that based on a wide variety of factors, there is a way to judge the probability or severity of a hypothetical crash and, in turn, influence the drivers on the road? A typical safe-driver would be eager to learn about this and gain answers as it could directly influence his or her cautiousness when driving. So, how do we find the answer? That will be in the model.
